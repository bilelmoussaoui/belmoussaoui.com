Late last year, I wanted to find an application that I can try the Rust async features with it. I started looking for a service that had a nice Rust API wrapper already and I started prototyping Read It Later on top of [wallabag-rs](https://github.com/swalladge/wallabag-rs/).

Read It Later, is a well designed [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.it/en) client.Â  Itâ€™s built with Rust, GTK & libhandy on the UI side. Itâ€™s fully adaptive which makes it Linux on pocket ready and also comes with a beautiful icon designed by [Tobias Bernard](https://tobiasbernard.com/).

It allows you to do the basic things:

- Login/Logout/Sync
- Add/Favorite/Archive/Delete an article
- Dark Mode Reader
- Adaptive UI

You can grab it already from Flathub at <https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.belmoussaoui.ReadItLater>. If you would like to contribute, the source code is available at <https://gitlab.gnome.org/bilelmoussaoui/read-it-later>

So far, writing apps with GTK & Rust have been a fun experience. GNOME Builder & Flatpak made the developer experience smooth ðŸ™‚
